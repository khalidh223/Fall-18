This project is a test of the `graphics` library offered in *Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science* by John Zelle and Python's `random` package. The project utilizes methods from both packages to draw a random set of mountains along with moving bison of random colors in a separate window.

# Files #

## `prairie.py` ##
Imports `mountains.py` and `bison.py` to create a prairie with a random set of mountains and bison with random colors. This is the file must be executed to generate the mountains, bison, and prairie as a whole.

## `mountains.py` ##
Generates a random collection of 20 mountains of different sizes and shapes by importing the Python `random` package.

## `bison.py` ##
Generates 2 bison with random colors that move across the screen, and change color when off screen by again utilizing the Python `random` package.

## `graphics.py` ##
File that contains the methods necessary to draw the prairie, mountains, and bison, offered by John Zelle.

**Note: Every file listed must be in the same folder in order to run `prairie.py`.**
