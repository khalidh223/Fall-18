This program does some simple data processing on a `.csv` file of weather data from the [Minnesota Department of Natural Resources](https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/climate/twin_cities/listings.html). It utilizes the `csv` module within Python to read from the file, and outputs the highest and lowest temperature and year it was recorded, the average high and low temperatures, the highest snowfall recorded and date (yyyy-mm-dd), and the highest participation recorded and date. 

The program can be run with the command `python weather.py` within the terminal.

# Files #

## `weather.py` ##
Program that needs to be run which will output the aforementioned information.

## `weather.csv` ##
File containing recorded weather data that is being read from.

**Note: Every file listed must be in the same folder in order to run `weather.py`.**
